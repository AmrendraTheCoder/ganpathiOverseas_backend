## üö® If Script Fails

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Permission Error**

   - Ensure you're the project owner

2. **Table Already Exists**

   - Script uses `IF NOT EXISTS` - safe to re-run
   - May indicate partial previous setup

3. **Connection Timeout**
   - Large script - may take time
   - Wait for completion before checking

### Alternative: Manual Table Creation

If automated script fails, tables can be created individually by executing sections of the script one by one.
